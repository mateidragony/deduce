theorem intro_less_irreflexive:  all x:Nat. not (x < x)
proof
  induction Nat
  case zero {
    assume z_l_z: 0 < 0
    conclude false by definition {operator <, operator â‰¤} in z_l_z
  }
  case suc(x') assume IH: not (x' < x') {
    assume sx_l_sx: suc(x') < suc(x')
    have x_l_x: x' < x' by apply less_suc_iff_suc_less to sx_l_sx
    conclude false by apply IH to x_l_x
  }
