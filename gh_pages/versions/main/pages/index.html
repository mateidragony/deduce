How index generation works:
  For the most part this is just a regular  markdown file
  However, there's extra "comments" to specify the structure
  of the html content. 

  Any links to images or pages should be relative to the gh_pages 
  directory, not the gh_pages/doc  directory. Do not link to 
  '../pages/blah'. Instead  link to './pages/blah'

There are four kinds of html "comments":
  - section : to separate large sections of the page
  - block   : next level separation within sections
  - figure  : next level separation within block
  - buttons : to create inline button groups

The syntax for the html "comments" is as follows:
  Start a type of divider with the name of the divider along with
  a potential class name. example:

    type
      or
    type: blah

  Then end that divider with end followed by the name of the type
  example:

    end type

There are four main sections whose structure should NOT change:

Header:
  Header contains a block with two bold headers and a button 
  group. You can add as many links to the button group as you 
  want! The header also contains an extra side image (the logo)

About:
  About contains two blocks which each contain a figure and a
  code block. This section appears with a gray background

Blocks:
  Blocks is the 4 information blocks that appear in a grid on
  the site. Each block in blocks contains a header, some text
  and a button group (again this group can have as many buttons
  as you want (just make sure they fit in the page))

Example:
  Example contains a bold header, some text, and a large code
  block. This section also appears with a gray background.

You can add as many additional sections as you want. For example,
the credits section, but I wouldn't recommend adding blocks or
figures within them since no css rules are written for that.
Feel free to add as many paragraphs and lists as you want!
